"that actually cared about Naruto , and not treat him like a monster."
Her designs are great and very cute.
"While she isn't really a fighter, she still puts up a good fight whenever she does battle."
"Like Tsunade , Konan, Chiyo, etc., she is one of the few well-written female characters in the series."
"Even though she is rather kindhearted and tender, she does have some really scary moments, most notably in the Boruto series."

"During the Chunin Exams, she allowed Naruto to cheat on her test, however he declined."
"During Naruto's fight with Kiba, Hinata's loyalties are torn; she wants to cheer for Naruto, but fears that would be rude to Kiba."
"After said fight, she gave some healing ointment to both Naruto and Kiba so their wounds can heal faster."

The scene where she confesses her feelings to Naruto is one of the most emotional/heartwarming moments in the series due to how much she loves Naruto and is willing to sacrifice herself to protect him.

"During the Fourth Great Shinobi War, after Neji collapsed from exhaustion, she took responsibility for monitoring the Second Division's perimeter with her Byakugan"
"When Neji sacrificed his life to protect Naruto and Hinata from the Ten-Tailed Beast, Obito taunts Naruto with his speech that if he keeps resisting, all of his friends will share the same fate as Neji, making Naruto nearly lost all hope and join Obito to stop further bloodshed, but Hinata prevented Naruto from joining Obito and encourages him to not give up and to not let Neji's death be in vain, which motivates Naruto to continue fighting and share his chakra with everyone."
"With her Byakugan, she saw the Ten-Tails being absorbed into Obito, meaning he has become its jinchuriki, and informed Sakura and the Alliance about it."
"During the Last, she decided to confess her feelings for Naruto by knitting a scarf for him, a replacement for the damaged one he gave her when they were children."
"Later in the movie, she gave the finished scarf to Naruto with her goodbyes and leaves with Toneri."
"While this seemed like she was marrying him, it turned out to be a plan to get closer to Hanabi, who has been kidnapped by him."
"Later on, she tried to reason with Toneri that Hamura never wished to destroy earth, but he doesn't listen."
"Then, Hinata attempts to destroy the Tenseigan Altar as per Hamura’s request only to be stopped by Toneri, after which he destroys the new scarf, that is actually meant for Naruto, and places her under his control."
"After being placed inside a picture frame, she shed a tear over her regret about ""betraying"" Naruto."

"In Boruto, she became a great mother, heck, she almost sacrificed herself to save Naruto when he was kidnapped by Momoshiki."
Her act of fainting when she sees Naruto can be repetitive to some people.
Her Road to Ninja Genjutsu world counterpart is just unbearable.
"Although she did it do in order to save Hanabi, it was foolish of Hinata to leave with Toneri, breaking Naruto's heart in the process and tried unsuccessfully to reason with Toneri, who responds by destroying her scarf and brainwashing her."
"Also, the scene where Toneri possesses Hinata can be heartbreaking to some people."
She shares a birthday (December 27) with Ochaco Uraraka from the popular anime/manga series My Hero Academia .
