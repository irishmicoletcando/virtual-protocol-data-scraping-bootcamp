            "19  These fleeting moments are representative of Hinata's entire arc as a whole: poorly written and filled with inconsistent development that's reset by the next episode because shy Hinata's is simply too cute to change.\n",

            "30                There is a brief moment where Hiashi entrusts Neji's life to Hinata during the Fourth Ninja War, but it's a flimsy olive branch when compared to his previous actions - on both Hinata and Neji's account.\n",
